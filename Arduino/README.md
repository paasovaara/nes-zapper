# Arduino

This project was implemented using Arduino Uno, but that is not a strict requirement. Source code utilizes some interrupts so those need to match. Also both Digital and Analog IO are used.

See (Bom)[BOM.md] for required components.

This source code targets to output 60Hz display. Some of the hardcoded filterings assume this, but it is not a restriction. Just change the code if needed.
