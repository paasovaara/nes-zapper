# Unity

This project was implemented using Unity version 5.4.1f1.

Application communicates with the Arduino (and the gun) using serial port, which is found on System.IO.Ports namespace. For this to compile you need to enable ".Net 2.0" instead of ".Net 2.0 subset" (which is default). You can find this setting from "Edit > Project settings > Player"

The Unity-game here is very much a proof-of-concept and does not contain much game logic.
